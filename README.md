# AI Demo - English project for TED
Here is the repo that I were talking about at school for an English project.
If you know what I'm talking about, install Mathematica 11, and type in a terminal the following commands:
```bash
cd ~
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
brew install git
git clone git@github.com:arguiot/AI-demo-TED.git modeltraining
```
And then, go to the `modeltraining` folder in your home folder (`~`, or the one with your name). Now, just run the `.nb` file in Mathematica.
